        <h2>Research Question</h2>
        <p>&ldquo;How do Sahra Wagenknecht and Lilian Marijnissen articulate and employ left nationalist rhetoric in their political discourse, and to what extent does this form of left nationalism function as a strategic response to counter the rise of far-right movements in their respective countries?&rdquo;</p>

        <div class="post-separator"></div>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Across Western Europe, far-right movements have gained significant traction by exploiting economic anxieties and social insecurities. In response, a relatively underexplored political phenomenon has emerged: left nationalism &mdash; a form of nationalism that combines advocacy for national sovereignty with the promotion of inclusive, progressive values. This thesis investigates whether left nationalism can function as a credible counterforce to the far right.</p>

        <p>The research centres on two prominent left-wing politicians: <strong>Sahra Wagenknecht</strong> (Die Linke / BSW) in Germany and <strong>Lilian Marijnissen</strong> (SP) in the Netherlands. Both have strategically positioned themselves to address national issues that resonate with working-class voters &mdash; concerns often mobilised by far-right parties like the AfD and the PVV. Through a mixed-methods approach combining critical discourse analysis of their speeches, media and public reception analysis, and electoral and survey data, the thesis examines how these leaders articulate and deploy left nationalist rhetoric.</p>

        <p>The analysis reveals that Wagenknecht and Marijnissen share a common strategy: blending social justice policies with themes of national sovereignty to reclaim patriotic narratives from the far right. However, their rhetorical styles differ significantly. Wagenknecht employs more confrontational language, drawing on metaphors of economic patriotism, identifying specific adversaries, and proposing radical systemic changes. Her critique of EU economic policies and globalisation aims to win back voters who have drifted towards the AfD. Marijnissen, by contrast, adopts a more measured, consensus-oriented tone, focusing on shared values and systemic issues rather than specific antagonists, advocating for incremental reforms within existing systems.</p>

        <p>Despite these strategic efforts, the electoral results are mixed. In Germany, the B&uuml;ndnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) has struggled to expand beyond its traditional strongholds, particularly among voters whose turn to the far right is driven more by cultural and immigration-related anxieties than by economic grievances alone. In the Netherlands, the SP has not seen significant electoral gains in recent years, constrained by a highly fragmented political landscape where numerous parties compete across the entire spectrum.</p>

        <p>The thesis concludes that left nationalism presents both opportunities and limitations as a strategic response to far-right movements. It can effectively address economic grievances and offer an inclusive alternative to exclusionary nationalism, but its overlap with nationalist themes requires careful navigation to avoid reinforcing the very sentiments it seeks to counter. The success of left nationalism ultimately depends on its ability to articulate a compelling vision of national identity and economic justice that resonates with an increasingly diverse and disillusioned electorate &mdash; without sacrificing core progressive values. Modern European politics, as this research demonstrates, is no longer simply about left versus right, but about balancing economic, cultural, and national concerns all at once.</p>
